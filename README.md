## Hi, Iâ€™m @mduhain ðŸ‘‹
*Michael DuHain, M.S.*

### Iâ€™m interested in how neurons encode tactile features in the somatosensory system.

### Iâ€™m currently a graduate student in the Haptics Lab at the University of Rochester.

### Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
1. MATLAB-based GUIs for controlling neurophysiology experiments
2. Automated approaches for spike-sorting neurophysiology data from large multi-laminar arrays.
3. Analysis of _in vivo_ calcium imaging data (gCaMP).
4. Computational modeling of cortical excitatory-inhibitory neural networks.
