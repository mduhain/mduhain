- 👋 Hi, I’m @mduhain

- 👀 I’m interested in how neurons encode tactile features in the somatosensory system.

- 🌱 I’m currently a graduate student in the Haptics Lab at the University of Rochester.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
1. MATLAB-based GUIs for controlling neurophysiology experiments
2. Automated approaches for spike-sorting neurophysiology data from large multi-laminar arrays.
3. Computational modeling of excitatory-inhibitory neural networks in the neocortex.

- 📫 How to reach me ...
